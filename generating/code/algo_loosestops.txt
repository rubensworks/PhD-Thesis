FUNCTION RemoveLooseStops(S, E, N, O, r)
  INPUT:
    Set of stops S
    Set of edges E between the stops from S
    Maximum number N of closest stations to consider
    Maximum average distance O around a stop to be considered a loose station
    Radius r in which to look for stops.
FOREACH s in S with degree of 1 w.r.t. E DO
    sx = x coordinate of s
    sy = y coordinate of s
    C = N closest stations to s in S excluding s
    c = closest station to s in S excluding s
    cx = x coordinate of c
    cy = y coordinate of c
    a = average distance between each pair of stops in C
    IF a <= O and C not empty THEN
        dx= (sx - cx) * r
        dy= (sy - cy) * r
        ox = sx; oy = sy
        WHILE distance between o and s < a DO
            ox += dx; oy += dy
            s' = random station around o with radius a * r
            IF s' exists
                add edge between s and s' to E and continue next for-loop iteration
