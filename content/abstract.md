<!-- Context      -->
The Web has become our most valuable tool for sharing information.
Currently, this Web is mainly targeted at humans,
whereas machines typically have a hard time understanding information on the Web.
Using *knowledge graphs*, this information can be linked in a structured way,
so that intelligent agents can act upon this data autonomously.
Current knowledge graphs remain however rather static.
As there is a lot of value in acting upon *evolving* knowledge,
<!-- Need         -->
there is a need for *evolving knowledge graphs*,
and ways to manage them.
<!-- Task         -->
As such, the goal of this PhD is to allow such evolving knowledge graphs to be *stored* and *queried*,
taking into account the *decentralized* nature Web
where anyone should be able say anything about anything.
<!-- Object       -->
Concretely, four challenges related to this goal are investigated:
(1) generation of evolving data,
(2) storage of evolving data,
(3) querying over heterogeneous datasets,
and (4) querying evolving data.
<!-- Findings     -->
For each of these challenges, techniques and algorithms have been developed,
<!-- Conclusion   -->
which prove to be valuable for storing and querying evolving knowledge graphs on the Web.
<!-- Perspectives -->
This work therefore brings us closer towards a Web
in which both human and machine can act upon evolving knowledge.
