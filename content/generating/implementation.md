### Implementation
{:#generating_implementation}

In this section, we discuss the implementation details of PoDiGG, based on the generator algorithm introduced in [](#generating_methodology).
PoDiGG is split up into two parts: the main PoDiGG generator, which outputs GTFS data, and PoDiGG-LC,
which depends on the main generator to output RDF data.
Serialization in RDF using existing ontologies, such as the [GTFS](http://vocab.gtfs.org/terms){:.mandatory}
and [Linked Connections ontologies](http://semweb.mmlab.be/ns/linkedconnections){:.mandatory},
allows this inherently linked data to be used within RDF data management systems,
where it can for instance be used for benchmarking purposes.
Providing output in GTFS will allow this data to be used directly within all systems
that are able to handle transit feeds, such as route planning systems.
The two generator parts will be explained hereafter, followed by a section on how the generator can be configured using various parameters.

#### PoDiGG

The main requirement of our system is the ability to generate realistic
public transport datasets using the mimicking algorithm that was introduced in [](#generating_methodology).
This means that given a population distribution of a certain region,
the system must be able to design a network of routes,
and determine timely trips over this network.

PoDiGG is implemented to achieve this goal. It is written in JavaScript using Node.js,
and is available under an open license on [GitHub](https://github.com/PoDiGG/podigg){:.mandatory}.
In order to make installation and usage more convenient,
PoDiGG is available as a Node module on the [NPM package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/podigg){:.mandatory}
and as a Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/podigg/podigg/){:.mandatory} to easily run on any platform.
Every sub-generator that was explained in [](#generating_methodology), is implemented as a separate module.
This makes PoDiGG highly modifiable and composable, because different implementations of sub-generators can easily be added and removed.
Furthermore, this flexible composition makes it possible to use real data instead of certain sub-generators.
This can be useful for instance when a certain public transport network is already available, and only the trips and connections need to be generated.

We designed PoDiGG to be highly configurable
to adjust the characteristics of the generated output across different levels,
and to define a certain *seed* parameter for producing deterministic output.

All sub-generators store generated data in-memory, using list-based data structures directly corresponding to the GTFS format.
This makes GTFS serialization a simple and efficient process.
[](#generating_table:implementation:gtfsfiles) shows the GTFS files that are generated by the different PoDiGG modules.
This table does not contain references to the region and edges generator,
because they are only used internally as prerequisites to the later steps.
All required files are created to have a valid GTFS dataset.
Next to that, the optional file for exceptional service dates is created.
Furthermore, `delays.txt` is created, which is not part of the GTFS specification.
It is an extension we provide in order to serialize delay information about each connection in a trip.
These delays are represented in a CSV file containing columns for referring to a connection in a trip,
and contains delay values in milliseconds and a certain reason per connection arrival and departure,
as shown in [](#generating_listing:example:delays).

| **`trips.txt`** | Trips |

In order to easily observe the network structure in the generated datasets,
PoDiGG will always produce a figure accompanying the GTFS dataset.
[](#generating_fig:generated_example) shows an example of such a visualization.

Each route has a different color, and dark route colors indicate more frequent trips over them than light colors.
The population distribution is illustrated for each cell as a scale going from white (low), to red (medium) and black (high).

Because the generation of large datasets can take a long time depending on the used parameters,
PoDiGG has a logging mechanism, which provides continuous feedback to the user about the current status and progress of the generator.

Finally, PoDiGG provides the option to derive realistic public transit queries over the generated network,
aimed at testing the load of route planning systems.
This is done by iteratively selecting two random stops weighed by their size
and choosing a random starting time based on the same time distribution as discussed in [](#generating_subsec-methodology-trips).
This is serialized to a [JSON format](https://github.com/linkedconnections/benchmark-belgianrail#transit-schedules){:.mandatory}
that was introduced for benchmarking the [Linked Connections route planner](cite:cites linkedconnections).

#### PoDiGG-LC

PoDiGG-LC is an extension of PoDiGG, that outputs data in Turtle/RDF using the ontologies shown in [](#generating_fig:methodology:datamodel).
It is also implemented in JavaScript using Node.js, and available under an open license on [GitHub](https://github.com/PoDiGG/podigg-lc){:.mandatory}.
PoDiGG-LC is also available as a Node module on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/podigg-lc){:.mandatory}
and as a Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/podigg/podigg-lc/){:.mandatory}.
For this, we extended the [GTFS-LC tool](https://github.com/PoDiGG/gtfs2lc){:.mandatory} that is able
to convert GTFS datasets to RDF using the Linked Connections and GTFS ontologies.
The original tool serializes a minimal subset of the GTFS data, aimed at being used for Linked Connections route planning over connections.
Our extension also serializes trip, station and route instances, with their relevant interlinking.
Furthermore, our GTFS extension for representing delays is also supported, and is serialized
using a new [Linked Connections Delay ontology](http://semweb.datasciencelab.be/ns/linked-connections-delay/){:.mandatory} that we created.

#### Configuration

PoDiGG accepts a wide range of parameters that can be used to configure properties of the different sub-generators.
[](#generating_table:implementation:params) shows an overview of the parameters, grouped by each sub-generator.
PoDiGG and PoDiGG-LC accept these [parameters](https://github.com/PoDiGG/podigg#parameters){:.mandatory}
either in a JSON configuration file or via environment variables.
Both PoDiGG and PoDiGG-LC produce deterministic output for identical sets of parameters,
so that datasets can easily be reproduced given the configuration.
The *seed* parameter can be used to introduce pseudo-randomness into the output.
