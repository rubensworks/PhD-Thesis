## Preface

For as long as I can remember, *making things* has been my greatest passion.
As I was fortunate enough to grow up with computers around me,
I quickly became fascinated by them,
and their ability to automate processes through sequences of instructions.
Next to that, I was born at the perfect time to experience the introduction of the Web to the public.
Hence, I grew up together with it, which has impacted my life significantly.
Thanks to the Web, I was able to easily *access information* on computers, programming, and Web technologies.
This allowed me to *learn*, and to *create* new things.

As a teenager, I was never really the type of person that played a lot of video games.
Nevertheless, like most people of my generation, I often came in contact with them.
Instead of being captivated to *play* these games,
I was often intrigued by the way these games *worked*.
This caused me to ponder on their internal processes,
and wondering what it would take to make it myself.
As such, I occasionally set out to [implement or extend certain games](https://www.rubensworks.net/projects/).
The thing I enjoyed the most, however, was building things that connect people over the Web,
which is why I also spent quite some time building Web sites to [distribute games](https://www.rubensworks.net/projects/tgcgames/)
and [broadcast music](https://www.rubensworks.net/projects/allectroradio/).

After I graduated secondary school,
the obvious choice was to pursue a further education related to computers and programming,
which is how I ended up at Ghent University.
The most impactful year for me was the final year of my Master's,
which is when I worked on my thesis.
Because of my existing interest in Web technologies,
I chose for a topic in the *Semantic Web* domain.
Under the excellent supervision of [Ruben Verborgh](https://ruben.verborgh.org/) and [Pieter Colpaert](https://pietercolpaert.be/),
I investigated [*continuous querying*](https://www.rubensworks.net/publications/taelman_mastersthesis/) within the Semantic Web.
Due to the motivating guidance of Ruben and Pieter, and my interest in the domain,
I continued upon that research as a PhD topic, and became their colleague at Multimedia Lab.

Working at <strike>Multimedia Lab</strike>, <strike>Data Science Lab</strike>, [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en)
has been very exciting so far.
I came in contact with many new interesting people,
learned about new technologies,
and traveled around the world.
Most importantly, I was able to (at least slightly) advance the research domain
through the contributions that are described in this PhD thesis.
All of this was of course impossible without [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton).
These giants are on the one hand all researchers that my work builds upon,
and on the other hand everyone that has directly or indirectly supported this work.

I thank all my current and past IDLab colleagues from our Semantic Web office:
Anastasia, Ben, Brecht, Dieter D. P., Dieter D. W., Dörthe, Erik, Gerald, Harm, Julián, Joachim, Laurens, Martin, Miel, Pieter H., Pieter C., Ruben, Sven, Tom.
Each of them has shaped this research in one way or another.
Either by providing feedback, coming up with new ideas that inspired me, or by simply offering help when I needed it.
In particular, I thank Ruben and Miel for their tireless enthusiasm and motivation.
I was able to learn a lot from you, which has definitely helped me in becoming a better researcher.
I am grateful to both Ruben and Pieter C. for inviting me to pursue a PhD at IDLab,
it has influenced my life in a very positive way, and I can not dream of a better job.
I am also thankful of all the critical and constructive feedback Ruben, Miel, Pieter and Anastasia have given me.

I thank my family for being there all my life, and shaping me into the person I have become.
Mom and dad, thank you being there,
for all the time and effort you have spent in me,
and all the opportunities you have provided,
I love you both.
Finally, Elke, I love you for showing me the sides of life that were unknown to me,
and I am glad to be living it with you.
